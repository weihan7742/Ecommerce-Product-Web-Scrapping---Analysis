Most of its commercials include a famous male celebrity, frequently with his family, who is eating Shin Ramyun at home. These commercials emphasize being family friendly, being Korean, and folksiness. Psy, a South Korean singer who is well known for his song ""Gangnam Style,"" and Park Ji-Sung, a South Korean footballer, also filmed Shin Ramyun commercials.

Nongshim has many jingles for their products. Adding a simple yet catchy jingle at the end of their commercials is one of Nongshim’s important marketing strategies.",RM63.50,n/a,0,0,newlineresources.online,2.1k,57,81%,within hours,12 months ago,1.2k

This is China version. Kindly be noted that there is not much difference between China and Korea version because China version is manufactured by company which is licensed and monitored by Korea. Hence the quality is the same as Korea. The only difference is that China labour and factory cost is lower, hence China version will have a price advantage over Korea version due to the lower overall cost, which is good to buyer.

【Version】

This is China version. Kindly be noted that there is not much difference between China and Korea version because China version is manufactured by company which is licensed and monitored by Korea. Hence the quality is the same as Korea. The only difference is that China labour and factory cost is lower, hence China version will have a price advantage over Korea version due to the lower overall cost, which is good to buyer. Please do not think that China version is poor as it is 100% wholly and entirely licensed and monitored by the Korea principal.

And now, Nongshim has introduced 「Non-Frying」with low calories !

「农心」家的“辛拉面”，作为长年韩国销量第一的泡面，独有的韩式味道，采用毫无油腻感清爽的辣味，再配上劲道爽滑的面条。另一款标榜「低热量、非油炸」版本的健康版的“辛拉面”，保持固有的浓郁韩式味，但是使用不油炸的干面，宵夜吃它也无负担啦！
