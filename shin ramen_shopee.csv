Hence the quality is the same as Korea. The only difference is that China labour and factory cost is lower, hence China version will have a price advantage over Korea version due to the lower overall cost, which is good to buyer.

SHIN·KOREA Ottogi Dakgaejang Ramen (Spicy Chicken Soup Noodle),"""The Luxury Noodle""

Type
1 Loose Packet (170g, 500kcal)
1 Bundle (3in1)

Highlights
The day when you think of the thick and spicy soup, meet Ottogi Dakgaejang Ramen. I caught both the taste and nutrition with the big chicken and the thick and spicy chicken gaejang broth. 
Ottogi uses large chicken breasts, green onions, taro, and other raw materials in abundance, and uses leeks and eggs to create a real garnish texture. In particular, in order to add more flavor and nutrition to the ramen, we used a retort pouch containing large chicken and vegetables with a good texture to add richer ingredients. In addition to making the broth more hungry with the noodles in the form of kalguksu, it also increased the dietary fiber content by adding oats to the noodles. Enjoy more by adding bean sprouts and eggs.
